# kitti-stereo-devkit-python
KITTI Optical Flow Evaluation 2015 devkit, but with python
For more info see http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_scene_flow.php?benchmark=flow
Currently this code does not work and has only the code for disparity
evaluation in the left image, but more is to come (perhaps).

# License
No idea. The cpp devkit from KITTI does not have a proper license, so I guess I
should just mention Andreas Geiger here.

# Dependencies
python >= 3
numpy
opencv
pandas

# Usage
